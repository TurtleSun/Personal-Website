                Hello! I'm Michelle Sun, a passionate BA/MS Computer Science major at Boston University. Currently, I'm in my last year and working as a Teaching Assistant in the school year while a Software Engineer AI Trainer during the summer. 
                My focus is on cybersecurity, and I've taken courses in introductory information security and graduate-level cryptography. Next semester, I plan to take network security and black hat security courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of academia, I am involved in a cybersecurity association, have participated in multiple Capture the Flag events (including on hosted by the Department of Defense), and have passed the CompTIA Security+ certification. 
                Please explore my projects and events!
            </p>

                <h3>Keylogger Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This keylogger script records all keystrokes made on a computer once executed. 
                    Designed with pynput, it captures characters pressed by the user and logs them to a file named keyfile.txt.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    Key Features:
                    <li>Comprehensive Logging: Captures and logs all keystrokes, including special characters.</li>
                    <li>Special Key Handling: Recognizes and logs space, enter, and other non-character keys.</li>
                    <li>File Output: Stores keystrokes in a designated file for easy access.</li>
                    <li>Stop Functionality: Allows you to stop logging by pressing the ESC key.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>WARNING: This tool serves as a demonstration of basic keylogging functionality and is intended for educational use. Please ensure you have permission to use it on any device.</p>

                <p>
                    May 20th: My first ever CTF! 
                    Through my experience in this individual CTF I learned much about the gaps of knowledge between academic theory and practical cybersecurity. 
                    For example, websites may have an robots.txt for subdomains not searchable.
